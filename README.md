#Prework Study Guide

## Description

This program is to educate myself in getting the most out of the Boot Camp. By constantly fixing issues and going back forth from Stack Overflow, I am able to realize a pattern, locate the issues, and resolve that issue. With this process, I was able to educate myself on functions within JS, creations of a CSS file, and what the sections are within an HTML file.

## Usage

By opening index.html in a browser, we are able to see the required outcome. Playing around with code can either rearrange the website however you want it, or create a bug. This prework-study-guide is made so we can alter certain lines of code and get an in-depth understanding of what each element does.
